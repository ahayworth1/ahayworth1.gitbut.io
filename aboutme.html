  <h3>Riding Bikes</h3>
  <p>I live near a lake that has a biking path so
     when I have some free time<br> and it is nice outside
     I like to go on a ride that is about 7 miles long.<br></p>

  <h3>Video Games</h3>
  <p>I also like to play video games with friends.
     However, I don't spend nearly<br> the time that I used
     to playing games which is probably a good thing.<br></p>

  <h3>Reading</h3>
  <p>Lastly I do enjoy reading sometimes. I don't
     have anything specific that I like to read<br> at the
     moment, but I did always enjoy the <em>Percy Jackson</em> book
     series<br> and the <em>Ranger's Apprentice</em> book series as well.</p>
